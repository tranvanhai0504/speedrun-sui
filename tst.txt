You are an expert Senior Frontend Engineer and UI/UX Designer specializing in Web3 Developer Platforms.

Task: Create a high-fidelity React/Next.js functional prototype for "Speedrun Sui" – a gamified learning platform for Sui Move developers, inspired by speedrunethereum.com.

Visual Style:

Aesthetic: "Hacker-minimalist" with a focus on productivity. Use a clean "Developer" theme (either dark mode or a very crisp light mode).

UI Elements: High-contrast typography (Inter or JetBrains Mono), subtle borders, and "card-based" challenge lists.

Vibe: Professional yet gamified. Use progress bars, status badges (Completed, In Progress, Locked), and builder avatars.

Key Components to Build:

Navigation Bar: Include a logo "Speedrun Sui", a global "Builder Leaderboard" link, and a "Connect Wallet" button using a placeholder for Sui dApp Kit (zkLogin & Wallet support).

Hero Section: A concise headline: "Master Sui Move by Building." Add a sub-headline: "Level up your Move skills by completing on-chain challenges. Start from a simple NFT and end with a complex DeFi Protocol."

Challenge Grid: A list of cards representing the curriculum:

Challenge 0: Simple Greeting (Introduction to Objects).

Challenge 1: Create a Managed Coin (Treasury Caps).

Challenge 2: Build a Decentralized Marketplace (Shared Objects & Kiosk).

Challenge 3: Programmable Transaction Blocks (PTB Master).

Challenge Detail View: * Left side: Instructions (Markdown style) and video embed placeholder.

Right side: A "Submission Panel" with inputs for Package ID, Transaction Digest, and a prominent "Submit & Verify" button.

Builder Stream: A sidebar or bottom section showing a real-time "Activity Feed" (e.g., "0x123...abc just completed Challenge 2!").

Technical Requirements:

Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

Use Lucide-react for icons.

The UI must be responsive and mobile-friendly.

Implement a "Course Purchase" modal UI using Sui Payment Kit style (showing price in SUI and a 'Buy Now' button).

Tips for Refining the Output
If the initial generation is too generic, follow up with these specific instructions:

For the "Sui" feel: "Add a visual representation of 'Sui Objects' appearing as cards with metadata tags (ID, Owner, Type) once a challenge is submitted."

For the verification state: "Create a 'Verifying' state for the submit button that shows a terminal-like log: 'Checking Package ID...', 'Verifying Transaction...', 'Success! Level Up!'"

For the Leaderboard: "Create a table showing 'Top Builders' with their SUI address, completed challenges count, and a 'Reputation Score' badge.
